                sing, and
                A new song is composed; When deep within the rivers of my soul I begin to hear the approaching sea, I
                pause and bask in sweet unity. I cannot bear but to see The unshakeable connection to Everything around
                me. New but Old By Jennifer Williamson When the leaves dance, and A new wind blows; When the birds
                sing, and
                A new song is composed; When deep within the rivers of my soul I begin to hear the approaching sea, I
                pause and bask in sweet unity. I cannot bear but to see The unshakeable connection to Everything around
                me. </p>
